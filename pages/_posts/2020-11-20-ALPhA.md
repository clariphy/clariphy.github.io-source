The Algorithms for Learning in Physics Application (ALPhA) group at Davidson College
completed a successful summer research program with nine undergraduate students from four institutions.
Due to the pandemic, the research was virtual and students resided across the world for their work. The group collaborated
with the detector, accelerator, and Active-Target Time Projection Chamber groups at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams and the Theory Center
at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. With laboratories required to stop beam for much of the summer due to the pandemic, increased focus turned towards computational methods.

As a testament to a productive summer within these unusual time, four summer students presented their work at the American Physical Society (APS) Division of Nuclear Physics (DNP) annual meeting and PI Michelle Kuchera represented ALPhA as a plenary speaker at the Low-Energy Community Meeting, and an invited speaker at the APS DNP meeting. In addition, five papers from prior ALPhA work were submitted this summer.
