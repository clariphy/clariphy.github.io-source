<h1>Our Mission</h1>

The Community Laboratory for AI Research at the Intersection with Physics (CLARIPHY) is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort between the particle physics and artificial intelligence research communities. It aims to understand how AI can radically extend the discovery potential of large particle physics experiments while simultaneously providing a unique environment for driving AI research in new directions. 

<h1>Particle Physics and Artificial Intelligence</h1>

From the mid-1980’s through the discovery of the Higgs Boson, fundamental physics has pursued and experimentally discovered and measured the last elements of the Standard Model. Guided by the expected structure of the Standard Model, these were "engineered" discoveries. The community knew roughly the kind of thing that it was looking for, even if it did not know exactly where and how it would appear. 
As such, it was able to prepare roadmaps such as "The Higgs Hunter’s Guide" and "The BaBar Physics Book" to search for the last pieces of the Standard Model.

Today, many exciting future goals include discovering “Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)” physics, but we do not have such pre-engineered models from which to start. Even the most theoretically popular models for BSM physics discovery (e.g. Supersymmetry in various incarnations) have not led to discoveries to date. Many discoveries do not come pre- announced (see pentaquarks, DsJ, etc.), and even the history of the Standard Model includes potential near misses (e.g. the charm quark discovery in 1974). And some big mysteries exist: What is dark matter? What is the physics behind neutrino mass? Where does the spin of the proton originate? A key question is how particle physics research can be open to the widest possible set of potential discoveries, and understand how to interpret them once seen.

AI and Machine Learning offer exactly this potential: if we are
successful with CLARIPHY, we can significantly expand the discovery
reach of all particle physics experiments by changing the nature
of how we approach designing experiments, the community vision of
data and its potential and our overall approach to discovery.
This is a moonshot, but the impact will be enormous if successful.

CLARIPHY is working to bring together the AI and particle physics communities to work jointly on research that will drive discoveries in both fields. The potential for transformative progress in AI results from engaging with particle physics research because it encompasses a broad spectrum of types of data and learning tasks all within the framework of a single domain with a highly mathematical theoretical underpinning and copious amounts of data, including from detailed simulations. The range of tasks spans from performing high-precision measurements on enormous data sets to the discovery of extremely rare phenomena, providing a variety of challenges for AI. 

The discovery potential in particle physics is tremendously enhanced because AI approaches are ideally suited to extracting high-level insights from low-level, high-dimensional data. AI has the potential to make physics analysis more sensitive, faster, and more robust. By fostering the intellectual community as well as providing the necessary cyberinfrastructure, including hosted datasets, reference algorithms, and documentation, CLARIPHY will serve as a vital nexus to facilitate both AI and particle physics breakthroughs that would not emerge from those fields in isolation.
